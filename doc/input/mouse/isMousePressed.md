# `isMousePressed`

```dart
bool isMousePressed;
```

The `isMousePressed` property stores whether a mouse button has been pressed. The `mouseButton` property can be used to determine which button has been pressed.

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has `draw()`. Without `draw()`, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
