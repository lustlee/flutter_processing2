# `mouseDragged()`

```dart
void mouseDragged()
```

The `mouseDragged()` function is called once every time the mouse moves while a mouse button is pressed. (If a button is not being pressed, `mouseMoved()` is called instead.)

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has `draw()`. Without `draw()`, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
