# `randomSeed()`

```dart
void randomSeed(int? seed)
```

Sets the seed value for `random()`. By default, `random()` produces different results each time the program is run. Set the seed parameter to a constant to return the same pseudo-random numbers each time the software is run.

To return to a natural seed value, pass `null` for `seed`.
