# `mousePressed()`

```dart
void mousePressed()
```

The `mousePressed()` function is called once after every time a mouse button is pressed. The `mouseButton` property can be used to determine which button has been pressed.

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has `draw()`. Without `draw()`, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
