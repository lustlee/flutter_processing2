# `noiseSeed()`

```dart
void noiseSeed(int? seed)
```

Sets the seed value for `noise()`. By default, `noise()` produces different results each time the program is run. Set the value parameter to a constant to return the same pseudo-random numbers each time the software is run.

To return to a natural seed value, pass `null` for `seed`.
